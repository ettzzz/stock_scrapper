# stock scrapper

---

a simple web scrapping script

all data from baostock.com, now it's only focusing on daily data

there are some sensitive infos are remained hidden such as database link, server's ip etc.

---

so how to use this script:

you can actually deploy a web service framework and keep it running with apscheduler

or simply use crontab to run main.py at anytime you wanted.


---

since it has fulfilled my personal demands of data collecting, it won't be updated 
frequently.

anyway no one will see this README.md except something amazing happened.
